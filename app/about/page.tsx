            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Safari Academy was founded in 2010 with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a learning environment
              where children could explore, discover, and grow at their own pace. Our journey began with a small group
              of dedicated educators who believed that education should be an adventureâ€”a safari of discovery that
              ignites curiosity and fosters a lifelong love of learning.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Over the years, we've grown from a small local academy to a comprehensive educational platform serving
              students across the country. Throughout our growth, we've remained committed to our founding principles of
              personalized learning, academic excellence, and creating a supportive community for all our students.
